# My Personal Website Project

## Overview

I made a website that's just about me and the things I like. I really like playing games and Magic: The Gathering. My website has a few parts.

* The main page has a game where you have to click fast.

* The gaming page talks about my games and you can even send me a message if you want to.

* The Magic: The Gathering page is where I rank the colors and I also made a thing that picks a color for you. I also put up some lists of cards that I like to play with.

I used HTML and CSS and JavaScript to make it all work. I like Magic: The Gathering and gaming and I thought it would be fun to make a website, about Magic: The Gathering and gaming.

The website is simple. You can look at it right in your web browser. It has its special style to make it look really cool like it is from old video games or it has some magic, in it.

## Features

- **Main Page (mainpage.html)**: This is where you start. You will see a picture of me and some links to my profiles on Steam, PSN and Spotify. There are buttons to help you get to pages. The main page also has a game where you have to click on shapes that appear on the screen really fast. The goal of the game is to test how fast you can react when you see these shapes. You will have to click on them soon as you see them. The **Main Page (mainpage.html)** is, like a page. It has all the links and a game to keep you entertained.

- **Gaming Page (gaming.html)**: This is where I list my games. I add pictures of the games and some fun facts about the games I like to play. I also have a form on the Gaming Page where people who visit my site can tell me about their games. The Gaming Page is really, about games and what people like about them.

- **Magic: The Gathering Page (magic.html)**: This is the story of how I got into Magic: The Gathering. I will also do a ranking of Magic: The Gathering colors. There is a button that generates a Magic: The Gathering color and it comes with a description. You can find links to my decklists, on Moxfield too.

- **Interactivity**:

- Reaction time game (JavaScript-based).

- Form validation and submission (logs to console; no backend).

- Random MTG color generator.

- **Shared Styling**: Custom CSS for backgrounds, fonts, buttons, and neon/retro effects.

- **Responsive Elements**: Basic grid layouts for game lists and flexible divs.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure of the pages.

- **CSS3**: Styling, including backgrounds, shadows, animations (e.g., flicker effect), and responsive layouts.

- **JavaScript**: For dynamic features like the reaction time game, form handling, and random color selection.

- **External Resources**:

- Fonts: Google Fonts (e.g., Orbitron, UnifrakturMaguntia, Beleren Bold).

- Images: Local assets (not included in this README; assume placed in an `images/` folder).

- No external libraries or frameworks (pure vanilla JS/CSS/HTML).

## Known Issues/Limitations

- The form, on the gaming.html page only puts information into the console. It does not send the information to a server to be processed or stored.

- Some HTML has mistakes like "widht" which should be "width" and "fiv" which should be "div" and "rouge" which should be "rogue". These HTML mistakes do not stop things from working. The HTML could be cleaned up. The HTML needs to be checked for these mistakes, like "widht" and "fiv" and "rouge" so that the HTML is correct.

- The background images on this website use links, from websites like the ones you find in CSS. So you need to be connected to the internet to see everything the way it is supposed to look.

- Not fully responsive for all screen sizes; optimized for desktop.
