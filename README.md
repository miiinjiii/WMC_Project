# My Personal Website Project

## Overview

I made a website that's just about me and the things I like. I really like playing games and Magic: The Gathering. My website has a few parts.

* The main page has a game where you have to click fast.

* The gaming page talks about my games and you can even send me a message if you want to.

* The Magic: The Gathering page is where I rank the colors and I also made a thing that picks a color for you. I also put up some lists of cards that I like to play with.

I used HTML and CSS and JavaScript to make it all work. I like Magic: The Gathering and gaming and I thought it would be fun to make a website, about Magic: The Gathering and gaming.

The website is simple. You can look at it right in your web browser. It has its special style to make it look really cool like it is from old video games or it has some magic, in it.
