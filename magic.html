                <h2 class="h2_magicpage"> How I got into MTG:</h2>
                <p> I got into Magic: The Gathering pretty recently, around August of this year. A few friends and I wanted a new card game to play together. We looked at several options, but Magic felt like the clear choice: it's deep, strategic, and has a huge amount of history behind it. </p>
                <p> One guy in our group had been playing Magic for a while, so he became our unofficial guide. He sat us down, explained the basic rules, mana system, and phases of a turn, and got us playing right away. </p>
                <p> After that, we learned through trial and error. We picked up a lot just by playing games. Whenever we got stuck, we'd go on YouTube for rules explanations or gameplay videos. To start off properly, we bought the Cloud vs. Sephiroth Starter Kit from the Final Fantasy Universes Beyond set. </p>
                <p> It was perfect: two ready-to-play Standard decks that felt thematic and fun right out of the box. We played many Standard games with those decks, making small adjustments as we got more comfortable with the format. </p>
                <p> However, we soon heard about Commander and how different it was: 100-card singleton decks, multiplayer chaos, legendary creatures as commanders. It sounded more creative and social than head-to-head Standard. </p>
                <p>That hooked us. We each began building our first Commander decks, and now it's basically all we play when we get together. The variety and stories that come up in every game keep pulling us back. Magic has turned out to be exactly the kind of hobby we were looking for: challenging, endlessly replayable, and a great excuse to hang out with friends.</p>
